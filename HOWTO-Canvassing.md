#Canvassing

##What is canvassing? (Definition regarding the project)
To examine closely, and gather information about the *Hardware*, *Travels*, *Research*, and more...

To be specific, it involves the gathering of data like the costs of the machine, the tags, the trip to venues like malls and universities
for research, and etc.

For the Hardware (machine), the cost, the complete specifications, strengths and weaknesses, and the like are needed to be canvassed.

Pick 1 sub-group

1. Hardware
   - RFID Scanner (Machine)
       - Cost - How much does the machine cost?
       - Specifications - Brand name, speed, storage, OS (if any?)
       - Strengths - How many tags can 
       - Limits
       - Knowledge - Facts, trivias, resources to learn about the machine.
   - RFID Tags (probably with Microchip)
       - Cost - How much does each tag cost?
       - Specifications -  Brand name, storage of data it can hold, etc...
       - Strengths
       - Limits
       - Knowledge
   - Components of RFID Scanner
       - Cost
       - Specifications
       - Strengths
       - Limits
       - Knowledge
   - Components of RFID Tags
       - Cost
       - Specifications
       - Strengths
       - Limits
       - Knowledge

2. Travels
    - Information of the venue (e.g. SM Dasma is the venue to buy components / attend a certain seminar)
    - Events of the venue (e.g. SM Dasma is holding a... related to Electronics/NFC/RFID)
    - Cost of arriving to the venue

3. Research
    - What is needed to be researched?
    - What resources are available?
    - Possible cost for these researched?
    - Seminar?
    
Take note: I may add more factors to canvass here, you may also canvass factors not included here, provided that it's related to RFID
Scanners.
